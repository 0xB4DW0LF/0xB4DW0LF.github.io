<p>Hello friend, welcome to my blog, currently with Covid-19 ravaging the world I figured I would update this, wipe the slate clean and continue blogging as a way to jot down my thoughts, primarily there will be two types of post at the time of writing, tech ones where I share technological things I have learned as a sort of reference and diary and another where I would write down my own personal thoughts and feelings as I traverse life my posts will be infrequent and wholly inconsistent, and I am irrevocably British so expect a random slew of content with a dry sense of humour blended down with wit.

Thank you. - 0xKR34M</p>
