<p>Hello friend, I weighed myself this morning and realised how heavy I was, at 315lbs - 22 stone 5lbs, I realised how far I have let myself go, I am well and truly morbidly obese and its not good, my addiction to sugar stems from wanting that feeling of freshness, it is a major addiction but I need to kick it, I can't keep on like this.</p>

<p>Thank you. - 0xKR34M</p>
