<p>I think it is kind of amusing that social media has taken over our lives to the point we spend more time on it than we do off it, we have replaced our social lives with browsing posed pictures of places that people cannot afford because going out with your friends is more important than putting away savings, living a lavish lifestyle and pretending we are doing better than we are is more important to quote a quote that has been over used yet still stands amazingly true; "We buy shit we don't need, with money we don't have, to impress people we don't like." -- George Carlin yet we still continue to do it, justifying our excuses to keep up with the joneses and ultimately is just bullshit so we feel like we're just as good as everyone else.</p>

<p>We have to justify our reasons for our privacy too, don't use Facebook? WHY?! Don't use Instagram? WHY?! don't use snapchat? You guessed it! WHY?! The fact you have to justify why you don't want a random corporation spying on you and trying to sell you more shit you don't need is insane in my opinion, I also don't care for what you had for breakfast, I'd rather talk to you in person about where you've been or what you've been up to rather than seeing it all documented on Facebook, I would rather you show me your photos of your holiday yourself and share your memories verbally, I would rather we connect like human beings than like I'm reading your diary.</p>

<p>Remember, if something is free, you are the product and I enjoy my freedom, I enjoy being able to talk to people. My level of privacy is my own to choose, not some data hungry company, not people who care more about followers and fake popularity, internet likes or retweets.</p>

<p>Thank you. - 0xKR34M</p>
