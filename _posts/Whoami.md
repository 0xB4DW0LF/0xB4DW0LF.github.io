<p>In a world where we are just numbers, where you do not matter, nothing you do matters. What are your options? There isn't that many I guess, I find solace in technology, its where I understand the rules, where I understand the society, who you are, the colour of your skin, your height, weight, age, does not matter. In the digital world what matters is ability, your ability to understand, to adapt, to improvise, to overcome the noise and see clearly.</p>
<p>Life isn't so good for me, I'm working towards my OSCP but that's the only thing that is benefitting me. <i>Infact</i> I think it is probably the only thing actually keeping me alive right now.</p>
<p>Hacking, makes me feel good, like I'm worth something, I don't want to interact with people, they bore me, I just want to be left alone in solace, to learn, to study, to improve, I want to be able to work remotely so I can just do my thing.</p>
<p>Goals for 2020, pass the OSCP.</p>
