<p>I find the obsession with social media exhausting, the question of are you on snapchat, instagram, twitter, facebook, tiktok, etc is one frequently asked, and then when you answer <b>no</b> it is met with disgust and distrust, why? We live in an age where everything we do is expected to be timestamped and catalogued, why is privacy met with such revulsion? Look at it from a different perspective, if I sat outside your house and watched what takeaway you liked, followed you into the cinema and found which movie you watched, if I requested you send me photos of your most recent holiday yet we have only known each other for a few minutes, would that not be considered creepy?</p>

<p>I understand the benefits of social media, but for someone like myself who doesn't want to plaster their life online, why am I made to feel like a criminal or untrust worthy because I don't do social media? The statistics don't lie, mental health improves by avoiding social medias like Instagram with all their fakery, that one photo that look a hundred shots to take, why is living a life instead of posing for every aspect of it considered normal? Instagram is a toxic whirlpool of horny men and people living lives they wish they had, girls using filters and editing their photos to make themselves feel better because they get more attention from their edited photos, but it's not real, not joining you in your addiction should not be labeled as negative?</p>

<p>There are so many ramifications from using social media, for example on my old email address the password reset questions were along the lines of Who is your best friend, name of your first Pet and which elementary school did you go to? All three could be answered by scouring your social media pages, and before you say that you have your privacy settings up, the average person does accept random people on their instagram or their snapchat, you might be one of many and thus think you're safe because you're a nobody but to the wrong person you could be their next somebody.</p>

<p>I'm not paranoid, I just like to communicate with people and talk about things I am interested in and what I get up to, rather than being treated like a product in a catalogue.</p>

<p>So please, social media addicts, don't judge me for not enjoying your drug.</p>
