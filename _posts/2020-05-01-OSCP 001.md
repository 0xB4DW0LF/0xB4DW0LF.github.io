<p>So I finally purchased the PWK course on the 28th of April 2020, it still feels kind of surreal like this is a life time goal of mine that I'm going to be going towards, to say I'm excited but also afraid is an understatement I will be receiving my materials shortly and I'm definitely going to be looking forward to everything I can learn, fortunately I have some good friends so far in my journey from TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and VirtualHackingLabs.</p>

<p>There has been a moment of fear that has washed over me however, the fear of "Am I Ready?" has really sprung to mind but then I have come to the conclusion, the PWK is not the end of the OSCP journey but the actual start of it, because people have beat it without THM, HTB, and VHL so why can't I? Also I have managed to bolster my confidence by rooting several boxes lately with no help so that is a confidence booster.</p>

<p>There's plenty to learn but then I have a minimum of 60 days to do so and plenty of potential times for retakes, one thing is for certain, I will not stop on the OSCP until I succeed.</p>

<p>Thank you. - 0xKR34M</p>
