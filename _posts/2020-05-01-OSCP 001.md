<p>So I finally purchased the PWK course on the 28th of April 2020, it still feels kind of surreal like this is a life time goal of mine that I'm going to be going towards, to say I'm excited but also afraid is an understatement I will be receiving my materials shortly and I'm definitely going to be looking forward to everything I can learn, fortunately I have some good friends so far in my journey from TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and VirtualHackingLabs.</p>

<p>Thank you. - 0xKR34M</p>
