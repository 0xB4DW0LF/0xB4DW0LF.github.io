# About Me

<p>I think of myself as a passionate yet stoic person, in times of adversity I become stoic, but in times of joy my passion shines through, I like to be motivated and I like to motivate others, no challenge is too great, no wall too high to climb, no mountain is indominable, I'm relentless in my pursuit, if it takes me a week, a month, a year, or a decade, I will still achieve my goal.</p>
