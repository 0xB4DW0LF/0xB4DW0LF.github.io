# About Me

<p>Currently an InfoSec student from the UK, I have two dogs and currently work in IT. I'm ultimately looking to make Pentesting my career of choice as I really enjoy the whole aspect of offensive security.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that it is a vital role as more and more personal data gets put onto the internet that we maintain security and privacy.</p>
