I"Œ<p>So in my attempt to prep for OSCP I spent a while googling ways to prep for the OSCP and that is where I came across FalconSpy's review of VHL link <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/@falconspy/virtual-hacking-labs-experience-9dcc0b402d23" target="_blank_">HERE</a> after some minor research online (you can tell that my prep for the OSCP so far has drilled in to me that you should research things you find) I found a lot of positive reviews about VHL so I decided to buy a month and at Â£100 if I didn't like it at least I would get access to a detailed PDF that would give me some extra knowledge.</p>

<p>Turns out that it was a very worthwhile purchase, they even provide you a sort of participation trophy if you write a report on 20 of their machines called the VHL Certicate of Completion, I even had mine laminated, you know, to make the parents proud.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from VHL, I barely knew how to get User creds on HackTheBox, let alone get full root on 20+ boxes at VHL. It taught me a lot of techniques that have thus far been very helpful, one thing I would say is that it does seem to rely on a certain type of exploit a lot but nobody is perfect and if, as I will find out in the near future, it's a valid and commonly occurring method of priv esc, then I guess it was very much worth it.</p>
