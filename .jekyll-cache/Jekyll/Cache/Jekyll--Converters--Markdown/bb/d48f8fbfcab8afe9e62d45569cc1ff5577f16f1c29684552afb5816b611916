I"e<p>So in my attempt to prep for OSCP I spent a while googling ways to prep for the OSCP and that is where I came across FalconSpy's review of VHL link <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/@falconspy/virtual-hacking-labs-experience-9dcc0b402d23" target="_blank">HERE</a> after some minor research online (you can tell that my prep for the OSCP so far has drilled in to me that you should research things you find) I found a lot of positive reviews about VHL so I decided to buy a month and at £100 if I didn't like it at least I would get access to a detailed PDF that would give me some extra knowledge.</p>
