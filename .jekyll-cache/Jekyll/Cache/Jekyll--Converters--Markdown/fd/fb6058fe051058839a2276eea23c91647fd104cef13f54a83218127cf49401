I"V<p>I recently purchased the Hak5 Essentials Fieldkit, it alleges to be a 10 piece kit that provides all of the essential tools.</p>
<p>Having no experience with physical tools I was a bit excited to say the least. It took around a week to arrive considering it came from the US to the UK, I was quite pleased with the speed of delivery.
